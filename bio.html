				Janelle was born and raised in Hawaii, where she competed as an age-group swimmer for the Kamehameha Swim Club. Her swimming experiences range from the collegiate pool, to open water, and triathlons. Being a 5'2" woman, she likes to swim smarter and learn to leverage what she's made of. Janelle has teaching experience with Kindergarten through eighth grade students. Her swim coaching experience ranges from the local to international stages of swimming competition. Over the last four years, Janelle has worked with athletes of all abilities, ages 8 and under to 18 and over. Working with such a wide range of athletes improved Janelle's ability to write challenging workouts for adult swimmers of all ages and abilities.
