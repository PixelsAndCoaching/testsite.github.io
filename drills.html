		<h1>Drills</h1>
		<p>
			The purpose of drills is to make you swim differently. Drills help to exagerate parts of your swimming strokes in order to really dig deep into a certain aspect of how you swim. If it feels like you are swimming funny compared to normal, you're doing it right. 
		</p>
		<p>
			After doing a drill, or set of drills, the next step is to carry those exagerated principles into your swimming stroke. Swimming is repetative by nature, making changes to your technique takes time and practice. Being able to hold this new technique or feeling in your stroke while you get tired, or go fast means you are solidifying that change in your swimming stroke. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Completing drills and workouts on your own is fabulous for you. Doing drills incorrectly can hurt your stroke technique. There is no substitute for the added benefits of having a real, live coach on deck. Swimming is a blind sport. Having somoene who can consistently watch your abilities develop and falter during practice to keep your technique accountable is irreplacable.
